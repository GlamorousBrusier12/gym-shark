        "description_en_us": "Primarily, there are three chest muscles involved in movement: the pectoralis major, the pectoralis minor, and the serratus anterior.\r\n\r\nPectoral muscles are most predominantly associated with movement of the shoulders and arms. When working together, they provide stability for bone structures such as the clavicle (collar bone) and the scapula (shoulder). Muscles of the chest enable us to lift, extend, and rotate our arms, along with playing a part in the process of respiration. Chest muscles are required in order to carry out everyday activities like moving furniture, lifting heavy objects, pitching a baseball, and stretching our arms.",

Both the hamstrings and the quadriceps pull on the knee joint, so if one of those muscles is stronger than the other, then knee problems are bound to arise. A good rule of thumb is to make sure that the hamstrings are 2/3 as strong as the quadriceps. For example, if you can resist 100 lbs with your quads, then you should be able to resist 66 lbs with your hamstrings.",

When working together, they provide stability for bone structures such as the clavicle (collar bone) and the scapula (shoulder).

Both the hamstrings and the quadriceps pull on the knee joint, so if one of those muscles is stronger than the other, then knee problems are bound to arise. A good rule of thumb is to make sure that the hamstrings are 2/3 as strong as the quadriceps. For example, if you can resist 100 lbs with your quads, then you should be able to resist 66 lbs with your hamstrings.",

When working together, they provide stability for bone structures such as the clavicle (collar bone) and the scapula (shoulder). Muscles of the chest enable us to lift, extend, and rotate our arms, along with playing a part in the process of respiration.

Together with the quadriceps, the hamstrings make walking and standing possible.\r\n\r\nThe hamstrings are made up of the following muscles - the biceps femoris (short and long head), the semimembranosus, and the semitendinosus.\r\n\r\nThe hamstrings are a weak muscle when compared with the quadriceps (front thigh muscle). Both the hamstrings and the quadriceps pull on the knee joint, so if one of those muscles is stronger than the other, then knee problems are bound to arise. A good rule of thumb is to make sure that the hamstrings are 2/3 as strong as the quadriceps. For example, if you can resist 100 lbs with your quads, then you should be able to resist 66 lbs with your hamstrings.",
